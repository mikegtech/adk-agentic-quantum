## Overview

By leveraging our corporate Apigee X platform as the standard API gateway for Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication, we centralize security, traffic management, observability, and developer onboarding—allowing agents to remain focused on business logic without reinventing infrastructure concerns :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

## Title

Use Apigee for A2A Inter-Agent Communication

## Status

Accepted

## Context and Problem Statement

We’re rolling out the A2A protocol to enable AI agents to securely discover, communicate, and coordinate across our enterprise application estate :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.  
Without a unified API layer, each agent would need to implement its own security, rate-limiting, monitoring, and developer-facing documentation, leading to duplicated effort, inconsistent policies, and potential security gaps :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

## Decision

We will use Apigee X as the API management gateway for all A2A endpoints. Key responsibilities include:
- **Enforce Security Policies:** Apply OAuth2 and JWT validation, encryption, and IP whitelisting at the proxy layer :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.  
- **Manage Traffic:** Configure quotas and spike arrest to uniformly enforce rate limits and prevent backend overloads :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.  
- **Provide Observability:** Utilize API Monitoring for near-real-time health insights and API Analytics for historical trend analysis :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8} :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.  
- **Enable Threat Protection:** Enable Advanced API Security to detect and block malicious or anomalous agent traffic :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10} :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}.  
- **Offer Developer Portal:** Publish A2A OpenAPI specifications and interactive docs in the Apigee Developer Portal for streamlined agent onboarding :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12} :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}.  
- **Scale Globally:** Leverage Apigee X’s multi-region edge caching and global load balancing for resilient, high-throughput agent-to-agent calls :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14} :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Custom Gateway per Agent**  
   - *Pros:* Full control over implementation.  
   - *Cons:* Reinvents core API management features; inconsistent security; higher maintenance.  

## Decision Drivers

- **Security & Compliance:** Integration with corporate IAM and security policies.  
- **Observability:** Unified dashboards for live metrics and historical trends.  
- **Scalability:** Support multi-region, high-throughput agent interactions.  
- **Developer Experience:** Centralized API discovery and onboarding.  
- **Operational Efficiency:** Managed service to reduce platform team burden.

### Positive

- Agents focus on their core business logic; Apigee handles cross-cutting concerns.  
- Consistent security, traffic policies, and monitoring across all agent endpoints.  
- Centralized analytics and alerting for faster incident response.  
- Leverages existing Apigee skill sets and investments.  

### Negative

- Gateway introduces minimal latency; requires performance benchmarking.  

## Implementation Notes

1. **Proxy Setup:** Create an Apigee proxy for each A2A service endpoint.  
2. **Security Configuration:** Attach OAuth2 and JWT policies; integrate Cloud Armor for IP filtering :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}.  
3. **Traffic Management:** Define Spike Arrest and Quota policies in the proxy preflow :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}.  
4. **Observability:** Enable API Monitoring alerts and export Analytics data to BigQuery :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}.  
5. **Portal Publication:** Publish OpenAPI specs and docs in the Apigee Developer Portal :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}.
