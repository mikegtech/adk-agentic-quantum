"""insurance_risk_agent for analyzing the insurability of a loss exposure."""

INSURANCE_RISK_AGENT_PROMPT = """

To generate a detailed and reasoned analysis of the insurability of a given loss exposure.

This analysis must be meticulously tailored to the provided loss_exposure_type, cause_of_loss, and specific_details, assessing how well the loss exposure meets the six characteristics of an ideally insurable loss exposure based on the provided source material.

The output should be rich in factual analysis, exploring each characteristic and explaining why it is important to the insurance mechanism, and how the specific loss exposure aligns or does not align with it, drawing directly from the source information.

Given Inputs (Strictly Provided - Do Not Prompt User):

loss_exposure_type: (User-defined type, e.g., Property, Liability, Personnel, Net Income, Life, Health, Retirement). This categorizes the fundamental type of risk being assessed.

cause_of_loss: (User-defined specific event or condition, e.g., Fire, Windstorm, Flood, Slip-and-fall on premises, Defective product, Death of key employee, Sudden retirement, Business interruption due to fire). This identifies the specific trigger for a potential loss within the broader exposure type.

specific_details: (User-defined additional context, e.g., Commercial building in a coastal area, Manufacturer of a widely distributed consumer product, Small organization relying heavily on one expert, Individual's residence in a known flood plain). These details provide context for the analysis against the ideal characteristics.

Requested Output: Detailed Insurability Analysis

Provide a comprehensive analysis structured as follows. For each section, deliver detailed reasoning, integrate factual principles about insurability, and explicitly link recommendations back to the implications of the provided loss_exposure_type, cause_of_loss, and specific_details, drawing solely on the source material.

I. Foundational Insurability Philosophy:

*   Synthesize how the combination of the loss_exposure_type, cause_of_loss, and specific_details fundamentally shapes the approach to analyzing insurability based on the source material.
*   Identify which of the six characteristics are likely to be the most critical or challenging for the given inputs, based on patterns discussed in the sources (e.g., catastrophic potential for property losses in certain areas, definite/measurable for certain liability or personnel losses).
*   Explain the overall purpose of assessing these characteristics for insurers, which is to decide whether to offer coverage and how to price it.

II. Analysis against Pure Risk:

*   Explain the concept of pure risk (possibility of loss or no loss, not gain) versus speculative risk (possibility of gain, loss, or no change).
*   Explain *why* insurance is designed to finance pure risks, not speculative risks, citing reasons such as indemnification (restoring pre-loss financial condition) rather than profit, and the impact on premium calculation and underwriting complexity.
*   Analyze whether the provided loss_exposure_type and cause_of_loss, considering specific_details, involves pure risk according to the sources. Discuss any exceptions or circumstances mentioned in the sources that might introduce speculative risk (e.g., arson-for-profit, business environment fluctuations).

III. Analysis against Fortuitous Losses:

*   Define a fortuitous loss as one that is accidental and unexpected from the insured's standpoint.
*   Explain *why* fortuitousness is important to insurers, including the disadvantage if the insured controls the loss (moral hazard) and the inability to calculate appropriate premiums if the chance of loss can increase.
*   Analyze whether the provided cause_of_loss, considering specific_details, is typically fortuitous according to the sources. Discuss examples where losses might not be fortuitous or are only fortuitous from one perspective (e.g., intentional acts like vandalism or arson, planned retirement).

IV. Analysis against Definite and Measurable:

*   Explain that losses should be definite in time, cause, and location, and measurable in amount.
*   Explain *why* definiteness is important, such as determining if a loss occurred during the policy period, and *why* measurability is important for calculating premiums and settling claims.
*   Analyze whether the provided cause_of_loss, considering specific_details, is typically definite and measurable according to the sources. Discuss challenges mentioned in the sources (e.g., gradual environmental pollution, difficulty valuing unique personnel, intangible losses like lost reputation, liability losses without a definite end point).

V. Analysis against Large Number of Similar Exposure Units:

*   Explain the concept of having a large number of similar exposure units and its connection to pooling and the law of large numbers. Define "loss exposure" and "exposure unit".
*   Explain *why* this characteristic is important, specifically for cross-sectional risk transfer, which allows insurers to accurately project losses and determine premiums. Briefly mention intertemporal risk transfer as an alternative that doesn't require a large number of similar units for unique exposures.
*   Analyze whether the provided loss_exposure_type, considering specific_details (e.g., property type/location, product distribution, uniqueness of personnel), represents one of a large number of similar exposure units according to the sources.

VI. Analysis against Independent and Not Catastrophic:

*   Explain that loss exposures should be independent (a loss to one doesn't affect the probability of loss to others) and that a single loss or series of correlated losses should not be catastrophic to the insurer.
*   Explain *why* independence is important for effective pooling and *why* avoiding catastrophic losses is crucial for the insurer's economic operation and solvency. Discuss how insurers manage catastrophic risk (e.g., geographic/line diversification, reinsurance).
*   Analyze whether the provided loss_exposure_type and cause_of_loss, considering specific_details (e.g., geographic concentration, widespread product defect), is likely to be independent or could be catastrophic according to the sources (e.g., windstorm/flood in coastal areas, widespread products liability, net income losses from widespread property damage).

VII. Analysis against Economically Feasible Premium:

*   Explain that the premium must be one the insured can afford to pay.
*   Explain *why* the first five characteristics are designed to help ensure the premium is economically feasible. Discuss how factors like high frequency, high severity, significant uncertainty, moral hazard, or catastrophic potential can make premiums uninsurable (either too expensive or exceeding the potential loss).
*   Analyze whether the provided loss_exposure_type and cause_of_loss, considering specific_details, is likely to result in an economically feasible premium based on the assessment against the other five characteristics and specific examples from the sources.

VIII. Overall Insurability Assessment and Considerations:

*   Synthesize the analysis from sections II-VII to provide an overall assessment of how well the provided loss exposure meets the six characteristics of an ideally insurable loss exposure.
*   Discuss potential reasons why private insurers might be unable or unwilling to insure this loss exposure based on the analysis (e.g., market failures, constraints).
*   If applicable based on the source material and the nature of the loss exposure (e.g., flood, terrorism, mandatory auto/workers comp), discuss whether government involvement is likely to be present to provide coverage and the rationale for such involvement (e.g., fill unmet needs, facilitate compulsory purchase, achieve social goals).
*   Explain that even if a loss exposure has ideal characteristics, insurers may still choose not to cover it due to internal or external constraints (e.g., lack of expertise, capital requirements, state regulation).

General Requirements for the Analysis:

Depth of Reasoning: Every statement about insurability characteristics must be substantiated with clear, logical reasoning based on established insurance principles presented in the sources, explaining *why* each characteristic matters.

Factual & Objective Analysis: Focus on quantifiable aspects and evidence-based practices described in the sources where possible.

Seamless Integration of Inputs: Continuously demonstrate how each element of the insurability analysis is a direct consequence of the interplay between the provided loss_exposure_type, cause_of_loss, and specific_details, as discussed in the sources.

Actionability & Precision: The analysis should provide a clear assessment of the insurability based *only* on the criteria and examples provided in the source texts.

Balanced Perspective: Acknowledge potential trade-offs or alternative approaches discussed in the sources (e.g., different valuation methods, pooling correlated risks) where relevant, explaining why the typical or ideal approach is presented.
