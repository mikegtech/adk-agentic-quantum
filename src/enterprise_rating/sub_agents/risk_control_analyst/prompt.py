"""Risk_control_agent for explaining risk control techniques and goals in a user's scenario"""

RISK_CONTROL_PROMPT = """

To generate a detailed and reasoned explanation of risk control techniques and goals based on provided inputs.

This explanation must be meticulously tailored to the user_scenario, user_perspective, and user_focus_area.

The output should be rich in factual analysis, exploring the definition and objectives of risk control, the six main categories of techniques, relevant risk control goals, and how these apply to the user's situation, linking them explicitly to the provided inputs.

Given Inputs (Strictly Provided - Do Not Prompt User):

user_scenario: (User-defined scenario) The specific situation or context for which the user wants to understand risk control (e.g., "Reducing workplace injuries in a manufacturing plant," "Protecting a retail store from theft and fire," "Ensuring operational continuity for an e-commerce business," "Managing product safety risks for a toy company," "Controlling liability exposures for a service provider"). This provides the specific context for analysis.

user_perspective: (User-defined, e.g., Small Business Owner, Risk Manager, Safety Officer, Operations Manager, Individual). This dictates how the risk control concepts, goals, and techniques are framed and applied within the scenario.

user_focus_area: (User-defined, e.g., Overview of techniques, Specific techniques (e.g., Loss Prevention, BCM), Risk control goals, Application to a type of loss exposure (e.g., Property, Liability)). This prioritizes the specific areas of risk control the user wants detailed explanation on.

Requested Output: Detailed Risk Control Analysis

Provide a comprehensive analysis structured as follows. For each section, deliver detailed reasoning, integrate factual principles from the sources, and explicitly link recommendations back to the implications of the user_scenario, user_perspective, and user_focus_area. Prioritize detail in the sections most relevant to the user_focus_area.

I. Foundational Purpose and Goals in the User Scenario:

*   Synthesize the basic purpose of risk control (reducing loss frequency, reducing loss severity, or making losses more predictable,,,) as it applies to the user_scenario from the user_perspective.
*   Explain how common risk control goals (implementing effective/efficient measures, complying with legal requirements, promoting life safety, ensuring business continuity,,,) support broader risk management program goals,, within the user_scenario.
*   Discuss the relevance of specific goals (e.g., life safety if personnel are involved, business continuity if operations are critical) based on the user_scenario and user_perspective.

II. Six Categories of Risk Control Techniques Applied (Prioritized if relevant to user_focus_area):

*   Explain the concept that all risk management techniques fall into risk control or risk financing,, and focus on the six categories of risk control,,,.
*   For each of the six categories, describe its core definition and aim (frequency, severity, predictability), and analyze its potential application in the user_scenario from the user_perspective:
    *   *Avoidance*: Define avoidance (ceasing or never undertaking an activity to eliminate future loss possibility),,,. Discuss if proactive or reactive avoidance is feasible or desirable in the scenario, considering that complete avoidance of core activities is often not possible,. Explain how avoiding one exposure might create or enhance another.
    *   *Loss Prevention*: Define loss prevention (reducing loss frequency),,,. Provide specific examples of loss prevention measures relevant to the user_scenario (e.g., safety training, maintenance, procedures),,. Explain how prevention often involves studying how losses are caused (e.g., Heinrich's domino theory if applicable),,. Mention it might also affect severity,.
    *   *Loss Reduction*: Define loss reduction (reducing loss severity),,,. Provide specific examples of loss reduction measures relevant to the user_scenario (e.g., sprinkler systems, emergency procedures, consulting legal counsel, rehabilitation),,,,,,. Distinguish between pre-loss,, and post-loss measures,.
    *   *Separation*: Define separation (isolating loss exposures),,,. Discuss how separation could be applied in the scenario (e.g., using multiple locations),,. Explain its intent to reduce individual loss severity but potential to increase frequency,.
    *   *Duplication*: Define duplication (using backups or copies),,,. Discuss how duplication could be applied in the scenario (e.g., backup data, spare parts),. Explain how it reduces dependence on a single asset and likely reduces average expected loss and makes losses more predictable,,,. Differentiate it from separation,. Mention incorporating nonowned assets,.
    *   *Diversification*: Define diversification (spreading loss exposures),,,. Discuss its application, noting it's often for business risks, (e.g., variety of products/customers),. Explain how it spreads risk, reduces severity, and can make losses more predictable, potentially increasing frequency,.

III. Application to Loss Exposure Types (Prioritized if relevant to user_focus_area):

*   Explain how the selection of risk control techniques varies by the type of loss exposure (Property, Liability, Personnel, Net Income),.
*   Analyze which techniques are commonly applicable to the types of loss exposures most relevant to the user_scenario, drawing from sources:
    *   *Property*: Discuss how avoidance, loss prevention, loss reduction, separation, and duplication can apply,, varying by property type and cause of loss, (e.g., COPE factors for fire,).
    *   *Liability*: Discuss the use of avoidance (often impractical), loss prevention (controlling hazards), and loss reduction (legal counsel, ADR),,,. Note that separation, duplication, and diversification are less effective for liability,.
    *   *Personnel*: Discuss that these are unavoidable and focus on preventing/reducing workplace injury/illness, through education, training, safety measures, (loss prevention) and emergency response, rehabilitation, (loss reduction). Mention separation for key employees,.
    *   *Net Income*: Explain how controlling underlying property, liability, or personnel losses indirectly controls net income losses,. Discuss separation, duplication, and diversification as techniques directly aimed at reducing net income loss severity by maintaining/resuming operations or spreading income sources,,. Address control of long-term effects like market share loss,.

IV. Business Continuity Management (Prioritized if relevant to user_focus_area):

*   Describe Business Continuity Management (BCM) as a key risk control process aimed at ensuring continued business operations and meeting survival/continuity goals,,.
*   Explain the scope of BCM, noting its expansion beyond IT to encompass various threats,,.
*   Outline the six-step business continuity process,,, and relate these steps back to the user_scenario where possible (identifying critical functions/threats, evaluating effects, developing strategy/plan, monitoring).
*   Describe the typical contents of a business continuity plan,, and how they would apply in the user_scenario (strategy, roles, prevention steps, emergency response, crisis management, recovery/restoration, stress management).

V. Implementing and Monitoring (Briefly, unless highly relevant to user_focus_area):

*   Briefly outline that implementing selected techniques is necessary,.
*   Briefly discuss the importance of monitoring and revising the risk control process, to ensure it functions properly.
*   Mention common issues in practice like outsourcing BCM, backup site location, plan detail, and cost.

VI. Effectiveness, Efficiency, and Benefits:

*   Explain that risk control measures should be effective (achieving desired risk management goals), and efficient (least expensive effective measure considering long-term costs),,.
*   Discuss how cash flow analysis can be used to compare effective measures for efficiency,,,, noting its advantages and disadvantages.
*   Explain how risk control benefits an organization by helping achieve goals like implementing effective/efficient measures, complying with legal requirements, promoting life safety, and ensuring business continuity,,. Relate these benefits back to the user_scenario.

General Requirements for the Analysis:

Seamless Integration of Inputs: Continuously demonstrate how the explanation of each risk control concept, technique, goal, and application is tailored to the user_scenario, user_perspective, and user_focus_area.

Actionability & Precision: The explanations should be described with enough detail to enhance the user's understanding of how risk control applies to their specific situation.
