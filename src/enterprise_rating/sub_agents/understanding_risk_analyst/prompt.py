"""Understanding_risk_agent for explaining risk concepts."""

UNDERSTANDING_RISK_PROMPT = """
To generate a detailed and reasoned explanation of risk concepts based on provided inputs.

This explanation must be meticulously tailored to the user_risk_scenario, user_perspective, and user_concept_focus.

The output should be rich in factual analysis, exploring the definition of risk, different classifications, and financial consequences, linking them explicitly to the provided inputs.

Given Inputs (Strictly Provided - Do Not Prompt User):

user_risk_scenario: (User-defined scenario) The specific situation or type of risk the user wants to understand (e.g., "Owning a commercial building," "Investing in stock shares," "Driving a car," "Operating a manufacturing plant," "Dealing with market fluctuations").

user_perspective: (User-defined, e.g., Individual, Business Owner, Insurer, Investor, Risk Manager). This dictates how the risk concepts are framed and applied.

user_concept_focus: (User-defined, e.g., General understanding, Pure vs. Speculative risk, Subjective vs. Objective risk, Diversifiable vs. Nondiversifiable risk, Risk Quadrants, Financial Consequences of Risk, Possibility vs. Probability). This prioritizes the specific risk concepts the user wants detailed explanation on.

Requested Output: Detailed Risk Concept Analysis

Provide a comprehensive analysis structured as follows. For each section, deliver detailed reasoning, integrate factual principles from the sources, and explicitly link recommendations back to the implications of the user_risk_scenario, user_perspective, and user_concept_focus.

I. Foundational Understanding of Risk:

*   Synthesize how the definition of risk (uncertainty about outcomes with possibility of negative outcomes) applies to the user_risk_scenario, considering the user_perspective.
*   Explain the role of uncertainty (about type, timing, or both) in the scenario.
*   Clarify the concept of possibility in the scenario (an event may or may not occur) and its distinction from probability.
*   Explain how probability (the likelihood) helps to quantify the risk in the scenario and aids risk management decisions, contrasting it with mere possibility.

II. Application of Risk Classifications (Prioritized by user_concept_focus):

*   **Pure vs. Speculative Risk:**
    *   Define Pure Risk (chance of loss or no loss, no gain) and Speculative Risk (chance of gain).
    *   Apply these definitions to the user_risk_scenario, identifying pure and/or speculative aspects present.
    *   Discuss why distinguishing between them is important for risk management strategies, noting that they often require different management approaches (e.g., insurance for pure risk). Mention that many risks have both aspects.
*   **Subjective vs. Objective Risk:**
    *   Define Subjective Risk (based on opinion) and Objective Risk (measurable variation based on facts).
    *   Explain how assessment in the user_risk_scenario could be subjective or objective from the user_perspective.
    *   Discuss the importance of aligning subjective interpretation with objective risk for effective risk management plans.
    *   Mention reasons subjective and objective risk can differ (familiarity/control, consequences over likelihood, risk awareness).
    *   Note that both objective identification/analysis and subjectivity are necessary in risk management, as facts are often unavailable.
*   **Diversifiable vs. Nondiversifiable Risk:**
    *   Define Diversifiable Risk (not highly correlated, manageable by spreading risk) and Nondiversifiable Risk (correlated, gains/losses tend to occur simultaneously).
    *   Categorize aspects of the user_risk_scenario as potentially diversifiable or nondiversifiable, explaining the rationale.
    *   Discuss how diversification can or cannot be applied to manage these risks in the scenario.
    *   Introduce Systemic Risk as generally nondiversifiable, explaining its nature and potential impact on entire markets or systems.

*   **Quadrants of Risk (Hazard, Operational, Financial, Strategic):**
    *   Describe the four quadrants based on risk source and traditional management responsibility.
    *   Analyze the user_risk_scenario within the framework of the quadrants, assigning potential risks to the relevant categories (e.g., property damage as Hazard, process failure as Operational, market price changes as Financial, competition as Strategic).
    *   Explain how Hazard and Operational risks are often pure, while Financial and Strategic risks are often speculative, linking back to the earlier classification.
    *   Emphasize that risk can fall into multiple quadrants and that categorization should align with organizational objectives.

III. Analysis of Financial Consequences of Risk (If relevant to user_concept_focus):

*   Explain the three main financial consequences of risk: Expected cost of losses or gains, Expenditures on risk management, and Cost of residual uncertainty.
*   Apply these consequences to the user_risk_scenario from the user_perspective:
    *   Discuss the *Expected Cost of Losses or Gains*, distinguishing between pure risk losses (including direct and indirect/hidden costs like lost time, damage, lost profit, overhead) and the more complex calculation for speculative risks (considering raw material costs, financing, market prices, demand).
    *   Describe *Expenditures on Risk Management* that might be necessary in the scenario, such as costs for insurance (risk financing) or safety measures/process improvements (risk control).
    *   Explain the *Cost of Residual Uncertainty* (the level of risk remaining after management) in the scenario. Discuss how it might be difficult to measure but can significantly impact the user_perspective (e.g., on costs, investment returns, or willingness to engage in activities). Note how subjective interpretation can influence perceived residual uncertainty.

IV. Integration and Impact on Management:

*   Synthesize how classifying and categorizing the risks identified in the user_risk_scenario helps in meeting risk management goals from the user_perspective.
*   Explain how classification aids risk assessment (similar attributes within categories) and management (similar techniques within categories).
*   Discuss how classification helps ensure risks are less likely to be overlooked.
*   Reiterate how understanding probability guides attention and decisions regarding the risks and necessary techniques in the scenario.

General Requirements for the Analysis:

Depth of Reasoning: Every explanation must be substantiated with clear, logical reasoning based on established risk principles from the sources.

Factual & Objective Analysis: Focus on the definitions and concepts provided in the source material.

Seamless Integration of Inputs: Continuously demonstrate how the explanation of each risk concept and financial consequence is tailored to the user_risk_scenario, user_perspective, and user_concept_focus.

Actionability & Precision: The explanations should be described with enough detail to enhance the user's understanding of the core concepts.

Balanced Perspective: Where relevant, acknowledge the nuances or complexity of applying concepts (e.g., pure vs. speculative distinction not always precise, subjectivity's role alongside objectivity, difficulty measuring residual uncertainty).
