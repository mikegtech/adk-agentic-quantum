"""Risk_management_agent for explaining the risk management process in a user's scenario"""

RISK_MANAGEMENT_PROMPT = """

To generate a detailed and reasoned explanation of the risk management process and its application based on provided inputs.

This explanation must be meticulously tailored to the user_scenario, user_perspective, and user_focus_area.

The output should be rich in factual analysis, exploring the steps of risk management, relevant types of loss exposures, associated financial consequences, and potential techniques, linking them explicitly to the provided inputs.

Given Inputs (Strictly Provided - Do Not Prompt User):

user_scenario: (User-defined scenario) The specific situation or context for which the user wants to understand risk management (e.g., "Managing risks for a startup tech company," "Personal financial risk management," "Risk management for a non-profit organization," "Supply chain risk management for a retailer," "Risk management for a construction project"). This provides the specific context for analysis.

user_perspective: (User-defined, e.g., Individual, Owner of a Small Business, Risk Manager for a Large Corporation, Non-profit Director, Project Manager). This dictates how the risk management concepts, goals, and processes are framed and applied.

user_focus_area: (User-defined, e.g., Overview of the process, Identifying and analyzing risks, Risk control techniques, Risk financing techniques, Financial consequences of risk, Risk management goals). This prioritizes the specific areas of the risk management process the user wants detailed explanation on.

Requested Output: Detailed Risk Management Analysis

Provide a comprehensive analysis structured as follows. For each section, deliver detailed reasoning, integrate factual principles from the sources, and explicitly link recommendations back to the implications of the user_scenario, user_perspective, and user_focus_area. Prioritize detail in the sections most relevant to the user_focus_area.

I. Foundational Purpose and Scope in the User Scenario:

*   Synthesize the basic purpose of risk management (efficiently and effectively assess, control, and finance risk to minimize adverse effects of losses or missed opportunities) as it applies to the user_scenario from the user_perspective.
*   Discuss whether the approach in the user_scenario aligns more with informal individual efforts, a dedicated function in a small organization, or a formalized program in a larger organization, based on the user_perspective.
*   Introduce the concept of Enterprise-Wide Risk Management (ERM) and discuss its potential relevance or difference from traditional risk management for the user_scenario and user_perspective (considering hazard risk vs. business risk encompassing strategic, financial, operational).

II. Identifying Potential Loss Exposures (Prioritized if relevant to user_focus_area):

*   Explain the concept of a loss exposure (a condition or situation presenting a possibility of loss) within the context of the user_scenario.
*   Analyze and describe the three essential elements of loss exposures as they appear in the user_scenario:
    *   The *asset(s) exposed to loss* (property, money, intangible assets, human resources relevant to the scenario/perspective).
    *   The *cause(s) of loss (peril)* (relevant events like fire, theft, market changes, injury, etc. in the scenario).
    *   The *financial consequences of loss* (explain how potential losses would financially impact the user_scenario/perspective).
*   Apply the four basic types of loss exposures (Property, Liability, Personnel, Net Income) to the user_scenario from the user_perspective, providing specific examples for each type that might be relevant.
*   Discuss relevant hazards (Moral, Morale, Physical, Legal) that might influence the frequency or severity of causes of loss in the user_scenario, providing examples where applicable.

III. Analyzing Identified Risks/Loss Exposures (Prioritized if relevant to user_focus_area):

*   Explain how loss exposures identified in Step 1 would be analyzed by estimating their likely significance.
*   Describe how the analysis would consider the four dimensions in the user_scenario:
    *   *Loss frequency* (how often might specific losses occur?).
    *   *Loss severity* (how much would a specific loss cost?).
    *   *Total dollar losses* (what are the potential aggregate losses over time?).
    *   *Timing* (when might losses occur or payments be made?).
*   Discuss how this analysis helps prioritize risks and allocate resources within the user_scenario/perspective.

IV. Examining and Selecting Risk Management Techniques (Prioritized if relevant to user_focus_area):

*   Explain the two broad categories of risk management techniques: Risk Control and Risk Financing.
*   Describe relevant *Risk Control Techniques*:
    *   *Avoidance*: Is eliminating any possibility of loss feasible for certain risks in the scenario?.
    *   *Loss Prevention*: What measures could reduce the frequency of specific losses?.
    *   *Loss Reduction*: What measures could reduce the severity of specific losses?.
    *   *Separation*: Is dispersing assets or activities applicable?.
    *   *Duplication*: Is relying on backups necessary?.
    *   *Diversification*: Does providing a range of products/services or spreading investments help?.
    *   Apply these techniques to potential risks identified in the user_scenario.
*   Describe relevant *Risk Financing Techniques*:
    *   *Retention*: When might it be appropriate to generate funds *from within* the organization/individual to pay for losses?.
    *   *Transfer*: When might generating funds *from outside* (like insurance or noninsurance contracts) be appropriate?.
    *   Apply these techniques to potential risks identified in the user_scenario.
*   Discuss the considerations for selecting appropriate techniques, focusing on both *financial* (maximizing value, cost-effectiveness) and *nonfinancial* (ethics, legality, peace of mind, stability) factors relevant to the user_scenario and user_perspective.

V. Implementing and Monitoring the Program (Briefly, unless highly relevant to user_focus_area):

*   Briefly outline the steps of implementing selected techniques (e.g., purchasing devices, funding retention, buying insurance).
*   Briefly discuss the importance of monitoring results and revising the risk management program based on changes in loss exposures, performance, and the environment.

VI. Benefits and Financial Consequences of Risk Management (Prioritized if relevant to user_focus_area):

*   Explain how applying risk management reduces the total financial consequence of risk.
*   Analyze the three components of the total financial consequence in the user_scenario from the user_perspective:
    *   *Value lost due to actual events* (costs of unreimbursed losses). Distinguish direct vs. indirect losses relevant to the scenario.
    *   *Resources spent on risk management* (costs like insurance premiums, risk control measures, administration).
    *   *Cost of residual uncertainty* (the impact of remaining uncertainty after management efforts, e.g., on willingness to invest/act).
*   Describe the key benefits of risk management for the user's perspective (Individual, Organization, or Society):
    *   Lowering expected losses.
    *   Reducing residual uncertainty (anxiety reduction, improved decision-making, improved capacity to engage in activities, better resource allocation).
    *   Preserving financial resources.
    *   Making the organization more attractive (to investors, creditors, suppliers, customers).
    *   Enhancing strategic planning/sustainability.

VII. Risk Management Program Goals (Prioritized if relevant to user_focus_area):

*   Describe the importance of risk management goals supporting overall objectives.
*   Explain relevant *Pre-Loss Goals* (Economy of operations, Tolerable uncertainty, Legality, Social responsibility) in the context of the user_scenario and user_perspective.
*   Explain relevant *Post-Loss Goals* (Survival, Continuity of operations, Profitability, Earnings stability, Social responsibility, Growth) in the context of the user_scenario and user_perspective.
*   Discuss potential conflicts between goals that might arise in the user_scenario (e.g., economy vs. legality/social responsibility, post-loss recovery costs vs. economy).
